## Releases and Semantic Versioning

We use GitHub's releases feature and semantic versioning for managing releases for our project. Here's how to create releases and use specific version tags for working with npm semantic versioning:

1. To create a new release, go to the "Releases" tab in the GitHub repository.

2. Click on the "Draft a new release" button.

3. In the "Tag version" field, enter your specific semver-formatted tag (e.g., v1.0.0) for the release.

4. Enter a release title and description to provide details about this release.

5. Click "Publish release" to create the release.

With this process, we ensure that every release in this project corresponds to a semantic versioning tag and a corresponding release on GitHub.
